            "Original Comment: As someone that lives in the Netherlands and recently received an AliExpress order via PostNL, I can tell you that your package is still in transit and is yet to be in PostNL hands. Most likely it’s still in China waiting for a flight to Europe. Once it gets to Europe, it will pass through customs and handed to PostNL. That is when PostNL can officially track it on their side and move it forward. Keep using sites like 17track and Parcelapp to track at the meantime. Just be a bit more patient, unfortunately your package is in that grey area of transit where the seller and the destination delivery service can’t give you much information. I had a package stuck at Hong Kong airport for 2 weeks with no updates but eventually started moving and picked up by PostNL tracking when it landed in Europe.\n",

            "Original Comment: Another important lesson I have learn from my recent loss is that sometimes the return shipping is not possible because in Singapore SingPost does not allow shipping products containing lithium batteries and AliExpress does not allow you to use commercial shipping (for refundable shipping cost). Under such a situation, AliExpress will side with the seller and forcefully deduct your money no matter how much feedback and appeal you have tried. And their customer support will simply bluff you by saying that they will escalate and give you a satisfactory outcome, and never take a look at your case. In fact, they do not even have a headquarter in Singapore where they operate. Therefore, I do agree with some people that \"Aliexpress itself is dishonest and disreputable\" sometimes, in addition, I would like to add another term, a \"shameful\" e-commerce.\n",

Didn't use to be this way. Every time I find a good deal and order it, a few days later I'm told to cancel and ask for a refund. Now, same store has ad on Ebay, I ordered and now told I can get a refund that the warehouse is out of stock. The item is still on AliExpress and Ebay listed and showing in stock with x number available.  Seems scammy, misleading to me. I think it is a bait tactic or just don't want to ship to certain places. 🤔\n",

I had multiple accounts because I wanted to keep my business and personal purchases separate but AliExpress banned or restricted or whatever the second account. Just go back to your original account if you had another one originally and you should be fine. If not you may have done something else. Like reversed a credit card payment or something else to violate their terms of service, or maybe its a glitch.\n",

Don't worry, this has no influence on your package, it is still on its way to you. However, you can only open disputes for 15 days after confirming receipt. If your order arrives later than that or not at all, you can't open a dispute about it. Next time, be more careful. Don't confirm receipt unless you really got the package.\n",

While at AliExpress it happened more frequently that the next batch had completely different sizing and material. Also, I presume it might vary per region, but here I found things to be much cheaper at Temu. Usually half the price than the one of the equivalent product at AliExpress. If it is not a Choice product, then shipping is usually at least as much as the base cost or more, if it is a Choice product then it costs as much as the non Choice variant with shipping. \n",

            "I can confirm that I just received an update to my order. AliExpress has changed the status to \"Package arrived at regional carrier facility\", and the SpeedX tracking now shows \"Processing at Designated Facility\" in Linden, New Jersey. My delivery date is technically the 13th-16th, though SpeedX says the ETA is today. Hopefully this means that whatever hiccups they were having over the past few days has been cleared. Hope your stuff starts moving!\n",

In my experience when the seller didn't respond I received a full refund, but if the seller does respond AliExpress may force you to return it at your expense. It's dumb as hell, especially on defective items, and I'm really curious how they get away with calling that \"free returns\", but, like I said, good luck actually getting any resolution from them.\n",

If the seller doesn't act on the ticket (and they won't ask on the ticket for you to close the request because they know it's a clear violation of the seller TOS) it will auto resolve in favor of you. Basically make them go through the proper channel to resolve (the ticket), not through DMs.\n",

            "Original Comment: I became Alibaba (AliExpess) member in 1999 while working in Southeast Asia. I've been ordering from them ever since, building relations with reliable suppliers. Never had a problem. These days though, there are many scammers trying to rip you off. Best advice I can offer is to avoid purchasing from sellers with names such as Shopxxxxxx. Look for suppliers that have been in business for more than a few years and try to get as close to the manufacturers as possible. Understand that AliExpress doesn't actually manufacture anything, they are a marketplace for others to advertise and manage the financial/shipping side of business. Having said all that and using a bit of common sense you shouldn't have any issues. For what it's worth, I opened a second account for online purchases using a debit card. I keep that account balance near zero and transfer money into it only when using it for a purchase and only enough to cover the cost.\n",
